## Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request, do not file combo issues.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix. Therefore:

* Provide reproducable steps, what the result of the steps was, and what you would have expected.
* Description of what you expect to happen
* Animated GIFs
* Code that demonstrates the issue
* Version of Iris
* Errors in the Terminal/Console
* When you have glide/godep installed, can you reproduce the issue when starting Iris' station without these?
